## DeepSeek Flashcard Generation

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
# Optional
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat
DEEPSEEK_API_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions
```

Flashcard review detail behavior:

- Only `character + pronunciation` are sourced from `public/data/char_detail.json`.
- Meanings, phrases, and example sentences are generated by `/api/flashcard/generate` in **Content Admin**.
- Admin path: `/words/admin` (preload, edit JSON, regenerate, save).
- Review page reads only admin-saved content from local DB.
- Each meaning keeps exactly 2 phrase/example pairs after normalization.
- Generated content is filtered for elementary-school-safe language and length constraints.
