# Flashcard Content Display Rules
THIS IS OUTDATED, READ WITH CAUTION

## Scope
- Applies to flashcard detail rendering based on `public/data/char_detail.json`.
- Display unit is per pronunciation (`pinyin`).

## Display Fields
- For each pronunciation, only display:
  - `pinyin`
  - `content` text list generated by the rules below

## Content Selection Rules
1. Always ignore any content containing:
   - `同本义`
   - `同本義`

2. Detect “本义/本義” content:
   - A content string is treated as “本义 content” if it contains `本义` or `本義`.
   - Display text must start **after** `本义`/`本義` and any following `:`/`：`.
   - Example:
     - Source: `(形声。从人,尔声。本义:称说话的对方)。`
     - Display: `称说话的对方。`

3. If a pronunciation has at least one valid “本义 content”:
   - First display all parsed “本义” display texts (deduped, original order).
   - Then append the first two non-本义 content texts (deduped, original order).
   - If fewer than two are available, append only available ones.

4. If a pronunciation has no valid “本义 content”:
   - Display the first two content texts (deduped, original order).
   - If fewer than two are available, display only available ones.

## Notes
- Output order matters and should remain stable:
  - `本义` results first (if any), then fallback non-本义 contents.
- Do not display examples, words, or other fields in flashcard detail under this rule set.
